The file **FacialKeyPointsDetection_GoogleCollab.ipynb** corresponds to the main code of the project where we execute the functions to find the keypoints of the training and test images. Additionally we have implemented a function to upload the any random image from the internet and apply to our model to find the face keypoints of the image uploaded.

The file **Facial_Keypoints_Detection_LIVE.ipynb** is implemented to detect KeyPoints for Live Faces
